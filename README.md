# KCNet-WinForms-Test

This is a test I made using some part of my code from KCNet-GiteaReleaseChecker on my local repo and modified a bit. Licensed under MIT.

Because that repo is mostly for my local gitea that isn't accessable from outside my LAN, I won't publish the code to it.
It is just a test for downloading files from my gitea releases.

# Features
This has a file dialog that opens up, and you can view the SHA256 sum of any file using it, I need to add a option to copy that SHA256 hash later.

There is a reset values option which sets the options back to default which is nothing.

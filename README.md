# KCNet-WinForms-Test

This is a test I made using some part of my code from KCNet-GiteaReleaseChecker on my local repo and modified a bit. Licensed under MIT.

Because that repo is mostly for my local gitea that isn't accessable from outside my LAN, I won't publish the code to it.
It is just a test for downloading files from my gitea releases.

# Features
So far you can check a SHA256 hash of a file in the current directory by specifying "./" as the filePath, and the fileName.

Place the file in bin/Debug/net8.0-windows, then this should work on it.
